## Warning!

This plugin to support svg images is not yet published.

The code is at https://github.com/rbrundritt/maplibre-gl-svg

To get these files I just copied them out the repo `src` directory.

(and manually removed the lodash bit, which wasn't being used).

The one in `dist/` did not import as it's not esm module, there might be a way though.

See the discussion about this at https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/175
