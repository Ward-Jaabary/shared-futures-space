Welcome to a project management platform where your community collaborates and gets stuff done.

On Shared Futures, your account is associated with an area, dictated by the post code you enter when first setting up your account.

Areas are known as 'Springs'. Within each Spring you will find projects, which we call 'Rivers'. Each River has 'Swimmers' — the people who contribute to it.

You can browse Rivers in all Springs. In your home Spring you can also join and contribute to existing Rivers, or start new ones.

Rivers are structured to help you move a project through from idea to completion. There are 4 stages to a River:

1. Envision
Discuss, shape, and capture your collective vision.

2. Plan
Make plans for how you'll achieve your vision.

3. Act
Share updates on how the plans are being carried out.

4. Reflect
Consider which resources on the platform helped you.

To move from stage one to the next, the Swimmers in a River need to agree on statements by passing a majority YES vote on a poll. The river starter can open polls in every stage. It might take some discussion, rephrasing, and more than one attempt for the poll to be passed, and that's OK!

What are you waiting for? Dive in and explore!

We hope you find this platform useful for developing the projects in your community.
