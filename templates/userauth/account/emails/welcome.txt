Welcome to a project management platform where your community collaborates and
gets stuff done!

On Shared Futures, each user that signs up belongs to an area, which is dictated
by their post code.

We call areas -> *Springs*. Within each Spring you will find projects, which we
call *Rivers*. Each River has *Swimmers* — people who contribute to it.

There are 4 stages that a River can be at any point:

1. Envision

2. Plan

3. Act

4. Reflect

All you need to know to get started is: to transition from one to the next
a majority (voting YES) is required on the *Poll* submitted by the River Starter.
More than one attempts might be required for the Poll to be successful and
that's OK!

We hope you find this platform useful for developing the projects of your
community :)
