      "description": "With the help of the community centre I’ve negotiated some space to plant some flowers on some land that the council has no use for currently. No big plans just some Saturday mornings to make an excuse for coffee and cake. I am happy to host as I’m local and an easy walk to the plot. We can take a look and then workshop at mine. So we are all happy before sowing in the spring. My friend’s daugher Catriona Jones is the local community gardener for area will be joining the group and will give tips and advice and approve our final design. Please feel free to bring your favorite biscuits or cake and I’ll have the kettle ready and everything else we’ll need. I’m posting a call out on my street’s whatsapp group and the local parent’s facebook also. I’ll keep you all informed of timings and post up our designs as they go here.",
